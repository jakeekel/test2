# SEMTU
SEMTU (SEt of sMall and tricky Test Units) is a public benchmark that contains set of examples that make KLEE generate incorrect test cases result in sequential program and not relevant test cases result in multithreaded program.
We provide two examples. First, the imprecision of symbolic analysis in case of dynamic memory management. Second, the influence of shared variables on execution paths of multithreaded programs.
